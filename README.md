# Bailey.js language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets for [bailey.js](http://haeric.github.io/bailey.js/) files in Atom.

Currently mostly a copy/paste of the [Coffeescript package for Atom](https://github.com/atom/language-coffee-script), with some changes and additions, as the two languages are very similar.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
